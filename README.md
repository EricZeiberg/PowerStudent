# PowerStudent
A Google Chrome extension that helps students calculate stuff on PowerSchool (a grading system for schools)

This plugin is only designed to work with West Hartford Public Schools, and has not been tested on any other school district's installation of PowerSchool. It is my understanding that there are major DOM changes between two installation of PowerSchool, and since this extension relies heavily on DOM parsing, it will probably break.
